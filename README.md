# seattle-airbnb


This project is about:

*Coming up with three questions

*Extracting the necessary data to answer these questions.

*Performing necessary cleaning, analysis, and modeling.

*Evaluating results.

*Sharing insights with stakeholders.

I have used Seattle AirBnB dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) to answer the following questions and find predictive variables for price.
  - Find what features affect an Airbnb price based on the features in the listings.csv
  - Find what is the trend of price change during an year.
  - Find what is the trend of prices change during a week.
