# seattle-airbnb

## UDACITY Data Scientist Nanodegree CRISP-DM PROJECT

This project is about:

*Coming up with three questions

*Extracting the necessary data to answer these questions.

*Performing necessary cleaning, analysis, and modeling.

*Evaluating results.

*Sharing insights with stakeholders.

I have used Seattle AirBnB dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) to answer the following questions and find predictive variables for price.
  - What are the peak days in Seattle?
  - Which areas are more pricy than others?
  - What are the major factors that determine prices?
